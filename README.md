# üí° DIY Multi-Channel Oscilloscope Based on Arduino UNO ü™õ

[English](README.md) | [‰∏≠Êñá](README_ZH.md)

## Project Introduction

An oscilloscope is a device used to observe various types of signal voltages üìâ. On a graphical display, an oscilloscope can represent voltage as a one-dimensional graph, where one axis represents time ‚è±Ô∏è and the other represents voltage ‚ö°. This allows observers to see how the signal changes over time, such as the periodic fluctuations of the signal. As an important electronic measurement tool üîß, oscilloscopes are widely used in circuit design, fault diagnosis, education, teaching, and scientific research üìöüî¨. However, due to their high cost üí∞, they may be unaffordable for students. Therefore, the author aims to use an Arduino development board to build a low-cost, multi-channel simple oscilloscope to support students' learning and research activities, providing a practical tool for electronics and electrical engineering education üõ†Ô∏è.

The Arduino Uno development board has 6 analog input pins, labeled A0 to A5. These pins can be used to read the output from sensors or other analog signals from devices. These signal voltages range between 0 and 5 volts. Arduino converts this analog voltage to an integer between 0 and 1023. By using these analog input pins, four analog signals are read. Then, the Arduino's analogRead() function is used to read the voltage of an analog pin. After calculation, the actual value, average value, maximum value, and minimum value are output to the LCD1602, and the waveform image is drawn on the LCD12864.

To test the effectiveness of the oscilloscope, the project includes a simple signal generator based on Arduino Mini, which can output square wave signals of different periods from pins 2 to 12.

## Feature Introduction

### Four-Channel Analog Signal Input
The oscilloscope can simultaneously receive and process four analog signals, which can come from various sensors or other electronic devices. The oscilloscope samples every 20ms, with a sampling frequency of 50Hz.

### Numerical Display
The oscilloscope uses a 16x2 LCD1602 display screen to show information. The screen displays four parameters: voltage value, average value, minimum value, and maximum value, switching between channels every two seconds.

### Waveform Display
The oscilloscope uses a 128x64 LCD12864 display screen to show waveforms. The screen is divided into four regions: top-left, top-right, bottom-left, and bottom-right, displaying signal waveforms input from the A0, A1, A2, and A3 analog input pins, respectively. Each region has a channel label in the top-left corner to indicate the corresponding analog input pin.

## Software Description

- **Arduino IDE**: Arduino IDE is an open-source integrated development environment. Users can write Arduino code in the Arduino IDE and upload it to the Arduino development board to run. Arduino is widely used in education, prototyping, and DIY projects due to its ease of use, flexibility, and low cost.
- **LiquidCrystal_I2C Library**: Used to drive the LCD1602 liquid crystal display. This library can communicate with Arduino via the I2C interface, requiring only two pins for data transmission.
- **U8g2 Library**: Used to drive the LCD12864 liquid crystal display. This library supports various displays, including OLED, LCD, LED, etc., and can communicate with Arduino via SPI or I2C interfaces.
